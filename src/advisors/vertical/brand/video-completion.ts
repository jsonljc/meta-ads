// Tracks ThruPlay / video completion rate trends for brand campaigns.
// Video completion rate (VCR) is the primary engagement signal for brand
// video campaigns — declining VCR means the creative is losing audience
// attention, which directly impacts brand recall and awareness lift.

// Data: ThruPlay (Meta), video_views (Google), video_views_p50 (TikTok)
// stored in topLevel by the platform clients.
