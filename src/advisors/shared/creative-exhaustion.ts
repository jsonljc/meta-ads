// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Creative Exhaustion Advisor (predictive — trend-based)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Unlike the reactive creative-fatigue advisor (which detects a single-period
// CTR drop), this advisor looks at multi-period CTR trends to predict
// creative exhaustion before it becomes critical.
//
// Requires historical snapshots in DiagnosticContext (minimum 3 periods).
// Triggers on 3+ consecutive periods of CTR decline, even if no single
// period exceeds the 15% threshold.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Predictive creative exhaustion advisor.
 *
 * Examines CTR across multiple trailing periods to detect sustained
 * engagement decay. This catches gradual creative exhaustion that
 * wouldn't trigger the single-period creative fatigue advisor.
