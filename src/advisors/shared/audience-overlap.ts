// Audience Overlap Advisor (Meta-focused)

// Detects audience overlap between ad sets by analyzing spend and CPA
// patterns. When multiple ad sets target overlapping audiences, they
// compete against each other in the auction, driving up CPMs and
// reducing overall efficiency.
//
// Overlap detection heuristics (no API call needed):
// 1. Multiple ad sets with similar CPMs + declining efficiency = likely
//    overlap (they're bidding against each other).
// 2. High ad set count with correlated CPA increases = audience
//    fragmentation causing self-competition.
//
// Data: SubEntityBreakdown[] from DiagnosticContext.
// Optional: AudienceOverlapData[] from context.audienceOverlaps
// (when Meta's delivery estimate API data is available).
